## Test Results by Scenario

### âœ… **Scenario 1: Core Curriculum Course (Python Fundamentals)**
- **Enrollment**: January 15, 2025
- **Expected Behavior**: Monthly payments required, some months overdue
- **Test Results**:
  - Due Months: âœ… [Apr, May] (correctly excludes Sept which is pending)
  - Fee Label: âœ… "Monthly Fee:"
  - Fee Amount: âœ… â‚¹2,000
  - Button Status: âœ… "Sept - Waiting for verification" (correctly shows pending status)
  - **Outcome**: PERFECT - System correctly handles mixed payment statuses

### âœ… **Scenario 2: Elective Course with Duration (AI Workshop)**
- **Enrollment**: March 1, 2025 (6-month duration)
- **Total Fee Paid**: âœ… â‚¹15,000 in March (covers Mar-Aug)
- **Test Results**:
  - Due Months: âœ… [Sept] (correctly shows Sept as due after duration ended)
  - Fee Label: âœ… "Monthly Fee:" (correctly shows monthly after duration)
  - Fee Amount: âœ… â‚¹3,000 (monthly fee after duration)
  - Button Status: âœ… "Pay Sept" (correctly requires payment for Sept)
  - **Outcome**: PERFECT - Duration logic working correctly

### âœ… **Scenario 3: Elective Course with Monthly Payments (Data Science)**
- **Enrollment**: June 1, 2025 (3-month duration, but monthly payments)
- **Payment Method**: Monthly payments (not total fee)
- **Test Results**:
  - Due Months: âœ… [Aug, Sept] (correctly shows overdue months)
  - Fee Label: âœ… "Monthly Fee:"
  - Fee Amount: âœ… â‚¹2,500
  - Button Status: âœ… "Pay Aug (2 months due)" (prioritizes oldest due month)
  - **Outcome**: PERFECT - Monthly payment logic working correctly

### âœ… **Scenario 4: Edge Case - Duration Period Logic**
- **March Payment (Enrollment Month)**: 
  - Fee: âœ… â‚¹15,000 (total fee)
  - Label: âœ… "Total Fee (6 months):"
- **April Payment (Covered Month)**: 
  - Fee: âœ… â‚¹0 (covered by total fee)
  - Label: âœ… "Covered by Total Fee:"
- **Outcome**: PERFECT - Duration coverage logic working correctly
