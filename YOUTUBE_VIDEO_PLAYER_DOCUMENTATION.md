## Features

### ðŸŽ¥ YouTube-Style Video Player

- **Full-screen video player** with responsive design
- **Landscape and portrait modes** with automatic orientation handling
- **Video information display** with title, description, and metadata
- **Resource access** to class notes and assignments
- **Suggested videos** sidebar/section
- **Professional UI** with dark theme matching YouTube's design

### ðŸ’¬ Comments System

- **Public comments** on each video
- **Nested replies** to comments
- **Real-time comment display** with user profiles
- **Like functionality** for comments and replies
- **User avatars** and timestamps
- **Rich comment interactions** (reply, like, etc.)

### ðŸ“± Responsive Design

- **Portrait mode**: Stacked layout with video on top, tabs below
- **Landscape mode**: Side-by-side layout with video and comments/suggestions
- **Adaptive UI** that works on all screen sizes
- **Touch-friendly** interactions and gestures

## Database Schema

### Video Comments Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE video_comments (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    video_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    course_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES courses(id),
    comments JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Comment Structure (JSONB)

```json
{
  "id": "unique_comment_id",
  "user_id": "user_uuid",
  "user_name": "John Doe",
  "user_image": "profile_image_url",
  "comment_text": "Great explanation!",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-03T10:30:00Z",
  "likes": 0,
  "replies": [
    {
      "id": "reply_id",
      "user_id": "user_uuid",
      "user_name": "Jane Smith",
      "user_image": "profile_image_url",
      "reply_text": "I agree!",
      "timestamp": "2025-07-03T11:00:00Z",
      "likes": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

```bash
# Run the setup script to create the video_comments table
./setup-video-comments.sh
```

Alternatively, you can manually run the SQL from `create_video_comments_table.sql` in your Supabase dashboard.

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS)

The setup automatically configures RLS policies:

- **Read access**: All authenticated users can read comments
- **Insert access**: Authenticated users can add comments
- **Update access**: Users can update comments (for likes, etc.)

### 3. Required Permissions

Ensure your Supabase project has:

- `authenticated` role with access to `video_comments` table
- `users` table with `id`, `name`, and `user_image` columns
- Proper foreign key relationships

## Component Usage

### YouTubeVideoPlayer Component

```tsx
import YouTubeVideoPlayer from "@/components/YouTubeVideoPlayer";

<YouTubeVideoPlayer
  video={selectedVideo}
  courseId={courseId}
  courseName="Course Name"
  onBack={() => setSelectedVideo(null)}
  suggestedVideos={otherVideos}
  onVideoSelect={setSelectedVideo}
/>;
```

### Props

- `video`: The video object to display
- `courseId`: Course ID for comments context
- `courseName`: Display name for the course
- `onBack`: Callback when user goes back
